## Project Overview
**CALMSTR** is the second app in the HealthNote ecosystem, focused on meditation, breathing exercises, and mindfulness. Building on RUNSTR's proven architecture with BLE sync and Nostr integration.

## I. Core Features Analysis

### Primary Functions (MVP)
1. **Guided Breathing Exercises**
   - Visual breathing guides (4-7-8, box breathing, etc.)
   - Customizable breath timing
   - Gentle vibration cues
   
2. **Timer-Based Meditation**
   - Preset durations (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes)
   - Custom timer option
   - Session progress tracking
   
3. **Mindfulness Reminders**
   - Periodic gentle notifications
   - "Take a breath" prompts throughout day
   - Customizable frequency

### Secondary Features (Phase 2)
- Session history and streaks
- Different meditation types (focus, sleep, anxiety)
- Background sounds/vibration patterns
- Integration with other HealthNote apps

---

## II. Technical Architecture Questions

### A. App Structure Options

**Option 1: Single-File Simple (Like early RUNSTR)**
```javascript
// Single calmstr.app.js file
// All functions in one place
// Quick to develop, harder to maintain
```

**Option 2: Modular Structure (Like enhanced RUNSTR)**
```javascript
// calmstr.app.js - main logic
// calmstr.breathing.js - breathing patterns
// calmstr.timer.js - meditation timers
// calmstr.sync.js - BLE/Nostr integration
```

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
```javascript
// Single file but well-organized sections
// Easy to develop and maintain
// Good for MVP, can split later
```

### B. Data Storage Strategy

**Meditation Session Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "timestamp",
  "type": "breathing|meditation|mindfulness",
  "duration": 600000,
  "startTime": 1704067200000,
  "completed": true,
  "pattern": "4-7-8",
  "device": "HealthNote Watch CALMSTR"
}
```

### C. BLE Integration Questions

**Should CALMSTR:**
1. **Use separate BLE service** (like RUNSTR's UUID pattern)?
2. **Share common HealthNote BLE service** across all apps?
3. **Use RUNSTR's existing service** with different characteristics?

---

## III. User Experience Design

### A. Main Interface Options

**Option 1: Grid Layout**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   🫁 BREATHE    │
├─────────────────┤
│   ⏱️ MEDITATE    │
├─────────────────┤
│   🔔 REMIND     │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Option 2: Scrolling List**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│    CALMSTR      │
│                 │
│ > Breathing     │
│ > Meditation    │
│ > Reminders     │
│ > History       │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Option 3: Quick Action (Like RUNSTR)**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│    CALMSTR      │
│                 │
│   Last: 10min   │
│   Streak: 5     │
│                 │
│  [START CALM]   │
└─────────────────┘
```

### B. Breathing Exercise Visual Options

**Option 1: Expanding Circle**
- Circle grows on inhale, shrinks on exhale
- Color changes with breath phase
- Text prompts ("Breathe In", "Hold", "Out")

**Option 2: Wave Animation**
- Sine wave that rises and falls
- Smooth, calming motion
- Minimal text overlay

**Option 3: Geometric Patterns**
- Square for box breathing
- Triangle for different patterns
- Abstract shapes for focus

## IV. Key Decision Points & Questions

### **A. Feature Priority Questions:**

1. **Which breathing pattern should we implement first?**
   - 4-7-8 (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8) - great for anxiety
   - Box breathing (4-4-4-4) - simple and balanced
   - Simple deep breathing (6 in, 6 out) - easiest to implement

2. **How complex should the meditation timer be?**
   - Just a countdown with start/stop?
   - Include pause/resume functionality?
   - Background/ambient features?

3. **What reminder frequency makes sense?**
   - Every hour during wake hours?
   - User-configurable intervals?
   - Smart reminders based on other app usage?

### **B. Technical Integration Questions:**

4. **BLE Service Strategy:**
   - Should CALMSTR have its own BLE UUID service?
   - Or integrate with a shared HealthNote service?
   - How should meditation data format differ from run data?

5. **Storage Strategy:**
   - Store each session separately (like RUNSTR runs)?
   - Or aggregate daily meditation stats?
   - How much data should stay on watch vs. sync?

### **C. User Experience Questions:**

6. **Main interface approach:**
   - Quick-start like RUNSTR (big START button)?
   - Menu-driven with different options?
   - Context-aware (suggests based on time/stress)?

7. **Visual feedback during sessions:**
   - Animated breathing guides?
   - Simple text prompts?
   - Vibration patterns only?

let meditating = false;
let sessionData = {startTime: null, duration: 0, type: 'meditation'};
let breathingActive = false;
let breathPhase = 'inhale'; // inhale, hold, exhale, pause

// BLE Service (similar to RUNSTR)
const CALMSTR_SERVICE_UUID = "00000003-7275-6E73-7472-5F69645F3031";
const CALMSTR_DATA_CHAR_UUID = "00000004-7275-6E73-7472-5F69645F3031";

// Main functions
function startMeditation(minutes) { }
function stopMeditation() { }
function startBreathing(pattern) { }
function stopBreathing() { }
function setupBLE() { }
function drawScreen() { }
```

## VI. Questions for You:

### **Immediate Decisions Needed:**

1. **Which breathing pattern should we start with?** (I recommend 4-7-8 as it's popular and effective)

2. **What's your preferred main interface style?** (Grid, list, or quick-action like RUNSTR?)

3. **Should CALMSTR use its own BLE service or integrate with RUNSTR's?**

4. **How important are visual animations vs. just vibration cues?**

5. **Do you want reminder functionality in the MVP, or save for later?**

### **Technical Preferences:**

6. **Should we follow RUNSTR's file structure exactly** (single enhanced file) **or try a different approach?**

7. **What meditation session lengths make most sense?** (5, 10, 15, 30 min or different presets?)

8. **How should CALMSTR integrate with the HealthNote Launcher?** (icon, description, etc.)

Ready to start coding once you give me direction on these key decisions! 🧘‍♀️✨
